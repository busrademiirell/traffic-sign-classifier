Traffic Sign Classifier
This project implements a Traffic Sign Classification system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify various traffic signs from images, which is a fundamental task for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

Project Overview
Model: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled traffic sign dataset.

Preprocessing: Input images are resized, converted to grayscale, histogram equalized, and normalized before prediction.

Evaluation: Includes metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix to analyze model performance.

User Interface: An interactive web app built with Gradio to allow users to upload images and get real-time predictions.

Features
Robust image preprocessing pipeline to improve prediction accuracy.

Easy-to-use Gradio-based web interface for live testing.

Detailed performance analysis with visualization of confusion matrix.

Model and preprocessing code fully available for reproducibility.
