# TRAFFIC SIGN CLASSIFIER

This project implements a Traffic Sign Classification system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify various traffic signs from images, which is a fundamental task for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Project Overview

- **Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled traffic sign dataset.  
- **Preprocessing:** Input images are resized, converted to grayscale, histogram equalized, and normalized before prediction.  
- **Evaluation:** Includes metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix to analyze model performance.  
- **User Interface:** An interactive web app built with Gradio to allow users to upload images and get real-time predictions.
