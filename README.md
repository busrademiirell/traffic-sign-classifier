# Traffic Sign Classifier

This project implements a **Traffic Sign Classification** system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify various traffic signs from images, which is a fundamental task for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Project Overview

- **Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled traffic sign dataset.  
- **Preprocessing:** Input images are resized, converted to grayscale, histogram equalized, and normalized before prediction.  
- **Evaluation:** Includes metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix to analyze model performance.  
- **User Interface:** An interactive web app built with Gradio to allow users to upload images and get real-time predictions.

## Features

- Robust image preprocessing pipeline to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Easy-to-use Gradio-based web interface for live testing.  
- Detailed performance analysis with visualization of confusion matrix.  
- Model and preprocessing code fully available for reproducibility.

## Dataset

This project uses the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset, which contains over 50,000 labeled images of various traffic signs. It is a popular benchmark dataset for traffic sign classification tasks and provides a wide variety of traffic sign types and lighting conditions.

- Number of classes: 43
- Number of images: ~50,000
- Source: [GTSRB Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
